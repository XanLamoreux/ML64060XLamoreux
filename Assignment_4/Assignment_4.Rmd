## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## using a shorter name "Pharma"

Pharma <- read_csv("Pharmaceuticals.csv")
head(Pharma)
summary(Pharma)
colnames(Pharma)

is.na(Pharma)

glimpse(Pharma)

apply(Pharma,2,function(x){any(is.na(x))})
Pharma_3to11 <- Pharma %>% select_if(is.numeric)
Pharma_3to11

# setting scaling 
# setting a seed can be a random number that helps to form consistency when running the data so each time you run it you won't get a new view

set.seed(22)
scale_data <- as.data.frame(scale(Pharma_3to11))


### can use the fviz_nbclust to "Dertemine and visualize the optimal number of clusters using different methods: within cluster sums of squares, average silhouette and gap statistics" https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/factoextra/versions/1.0.7/topics/fviz_nbclust


### K-means clustering - Elbow is one of the most famous methods by which you can select the right value of k and boost your model performance.It is an empirical method to find out the best value of k. it picks up the range of values and takes the best among them. It calculates the sum of the square of the points and calculates the average distance.Plot a graph between k-values and the within-cluster sum of the square to get the k value. we will examine the graph carefully. At some point, our graph will decrease abruptly. That point will be considered as a value of k.

## The silhouette method calculates the silhouette coefficient of every point. It calculates the average distance of points within its cluster a (i) and the average distance of the points to its next closest cluster called b (i).

wss <- fviz_nbclust(scale_data,FUNcluster=kmeans,method="wss")
plot(wss)

sil <- fviz_nbclust(scale_data,FUNcluster=kmeans,method="silhouette")
plot(sil)

## view side by side to compare the two optimal plots

plot_grid(wss,sil)


## testing 3 clusters and 5 clusters to see what makes sense

model_k3 <- kmeans(scale_data,centers=3,nstart=25)
model_k3

plot_k3 <- fviz_cluster(model_k3,data=scale_data,main="plot for k3")
plot_k3

model_k5 <- kmeans(scale_data,centers=5,nstart=25)
model_k5

plot_k5 <- fviz_cluster(model_k5,data=scale_data,main="plot for k5")
plot_k5


## Visualizing the k=3 by Median Recommendation, Location, and Exchange

Pharma_3to14 <- Pharma %>% select(c("Median_Recommendation", "Location", "Exchange")) %>% mutate(cluster=model_k3$cluster)
Pharma_3to14

library(ggplot2)


ggplot(Pharma_3to14,aes(fill=Median_Recommendation,x=as.factor(cluster)))+geom_bar()
ggplot(Pharma_3to14,aes(fill=Location,x=as.factor(cluster)))+geom_bar()
ggplot(Pharma_3to14,aes(fill=Exchange,x=as.factor(cluster)))+geom_bar()


## Visualizing the k=5 by Median Recommendation, Location, and Exchange


Pharma_3to14 <- Pharma %>% select(c("Median_Recommendation", "Location", "Exchange")) %>% mutate(cluster=model_k5$cluster)
Pharma_3to14


ggplot(Pharma_3to14,aes(fill=Median_Recommendation,x=as.factor(cluster)))+geom_bar()
ggplot(Pharma_3to14,aes(fill=Location,x=as.factor(cluster)))+geom_bar()
ggplot(Pharma_3to14,aes(fill=Exchange,x=as.factor(cluster)))+geom_bar()


## I believe that the 5 clusters provide a clearer indication of appropriate clusters. I do not think that the Exhange is a good indicator for grouping because almost all stocks are on the NYSE. I do believe that cluster group 4 has the most diversity by country of origin and also has the most volitility in the recommendations. Group 4 also is the only group that has anything with a strong buy rating. It appears that group 4 has the most activity.
